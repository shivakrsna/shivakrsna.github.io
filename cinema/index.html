        <p> Since childhood, I had the love towards Editing and Dance. I'm currently studying at University of Hyderabad, meanwhile trying to showcase my love for cinema by trying to make short films and other forms of content.
            <br> Me and my friend Preetam(a crazy music enthusiast) together started a channel called <strong>"House of Chaos"</strong> where we put all of it in.

        <h2>Chapter-1: Poga Puranam</h2>
        <p> Our first project was done in July 2024 which is "<u>Poga Puranam</u>", a short film in which a cigarette narrates its user's life.<br> Music and Cinematography was done by Preetam. I handled the Writing, Editing and the Direction part. Special credits to my School senior Srividya for lending her voice to my cigarette.<br>We've done it in 6 days with a camera that we already had with spending only 200rs for the ayurvedic cigarettes that we used for the short film.<br> It ended up as being a good learning curve to start with, giving us the confidence to hit better things with the next ones.</p>
